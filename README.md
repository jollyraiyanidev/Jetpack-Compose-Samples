# Jetpack-Compose-ViewPager

I divided the problem into four distinct parts:

1. Transforming the HorizontalPager to achieve the desired carousel effect.,
2. Incorporating indicators to display the currently visible page.,
3. Implementing automatic scrolling for the HorizontalPager pages.,
4. Utilizing animation to enhance the appearance of upcoming pages, while focusing on the currently displayed page and fading out the others.
